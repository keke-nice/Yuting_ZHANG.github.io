I'm Yuting Zhang, a first-year PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of Professor Kaishun Wu. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Communication Engineering from Tianjin University in 2021 and 2024, respectively. My research interests include multimodal large language models and AI for healthcare.
