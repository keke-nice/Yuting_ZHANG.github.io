I'm Yuting Zhang, a first-year PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of [Prof. Kaishun Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vt-q3E4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Communication Engineering from Tianjin University in 2021 and 2024, respectively. My research interests include multimodal large language models and AI for healthcare.
